## Obtaining a Malaysian Driving License

Obtaining a driving license in Malaysia involves several steps and requirements.  First, you'll need to apply for a learner's permit at a JPJ (Jabatan Pengangkutan Jalan) office.  This requires you to be at least 16 years old and pass a written test demonstrating your knowledge of road rules and regulations.  You will also need to provide certain documents like your MyKad or passport, and recent passport-sized photographs.  After obtaining your learner's permit, you must complete a minimum number of driving hours with an approved driving instructor. You will undergo practical driving assessments to ensure you have adequate driving skills.

Once you've successfully completed your driving lessons, you'll be eligible to take the practical driving test at the JPJ.  This test evaluates your driving skills on the road, covering aspects like parallel parking, lane changing, and navigating various traffic conditions.  Successful completion of the practical test will lead to the issuance of a Provisional Driving License (PDL).  A PDL comes with certain restrictions, such as limitations on the types of vehicles you can drive.

The PDL typically has a validity period of two years.  After two years of holding a PDL and maintaining a clean driving record, you can apply for a full driving license.  You'll need to visit a JPJ office again, undergo a medical examination, and submit an application form with the required supporting documents.

This process emphasizes road safety and ensures drivers have the necessary skills to navigate Malaysian roads responsibly. Remember to always refer to the latest guidelines and regulations from the JPJ for the most up-to-date information.  Contact your local JPJ office or visit their website for complete details.
